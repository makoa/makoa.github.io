<p>In rummaging through the emails, I came across the email from Blaine to someone in the Endowment group about a presentation in Jay Fidel's 2005 ThinkTech Law Series.  (Jay Fidel now publishes a column in the Honolulu Advertiser and currently leads ThinkTech Hawaii.)  I was asked to make an appearance to talk about developing software from KS as part of the Endowment group's presentation.  It was definitely not part of the subject matter, something I realized very quickly after their part of the presentation concluded.</p>
<p>Anyway, Blaine confirmed my joining them.  See the exert below:</p>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Hi Dana,</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Not using Powerpoint, using Apple Keynote. We'll bring our own laptop. UH Outreach classroom and conference room have built in projectors. We'll need a net connection (they have plenty). The laptop will have wireless, too.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">He can talk until you give him the cut signal from the back of the room. He was limited to 15 minutes for his HiTechQuest presentation, and he practiced it to precision, with time for a few Q&amp;A afterward.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Trust me, it is top-level, professional.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Bliane</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">Yippppeeee!  (My non-professional response to Makoa joining us next Tuesday.)  Thanks for the great news, Blaine!  Could I get some basic information for our planning session:</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">1.       Will you need any equipment for the presentation?  We will be bringing our own PC laptop and projector.  Will you be bringing your own laptop or do you need us to get one set-up?</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">2.       How long is the presentation?  We'd like to keep down to 15-20 minutes.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">3.       Could you send us a copy of the powerpoint in paper?  Remember, this is a non-tech person talking.  I just want to see each of the panels and I don't think I have enough room on my computer to open up the presentation in power point.</div>
<div id="_mcePaste" style="position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 28px; width: 1px; height: 1px;">FYI, we're planning to take the both of you to dinner upstairs at the Plaza Club.</div>

<p>Yes, Blaine did not spell his name correctly in the reply.  ;)</p>
<p>I remember presenting the Student Registration System, and I remember Jay Fidel being impressed.  He had heard of us from a little conference we put on in Midkiff called HiTechFest in 2004.  It was an attempt to do our own HiTech Quest but be more information rather than competitive.</p>
<p>You know someone is impressed when they can remember you two years later.  Dr. Larry Mordan, Science Dept Head, told me one day in Smith Office that he and Keoni Kaleiwahea went on Jay Fidel's radio show to talk about the science fair.  And somehow I came up.  Jay didn't remember my name but he remembered seeing that presentation.  Dr. Mordan told me that he and Keoni looked at each other and knew exactly to whom he was referring.  The episode podcast is <a href="http://www.thinktechhawaii.com/sounds/ChristineTrustyLarryMordanKeoniKaleiwahea.mp3">here</a>.  The start of the science segment is around 30 minutes into the podcast (closer to 31 minutes).  My mention was actually in the after-segment, which is <a href="http://www.thinktechhawaii.com/sounds/ChristineTrustyLarryMordanKeoniKaleiwaheaAS.mp3">here</a>.  It's around 23 minutes into the presentation when I'm mentioned.</p>
