<p>So before I get into this...</p>
<ol>
<li>I did not take AP English so my grammar isn't perfect.  If Jim Slagel is reading, well, ever reads this (it could happen, he has a Facebook, gasp!) or any of his students, no comments to me on grammar.  Generally, grammar is very logical.  I'm very logical.  The grammar I use is logical grammar, a part of the Makoa Method.</li>
<li>I may or may not mention names.  If I do mention your name, it was important enough that it should be mentioned.  It's a compliment.  Be happy!</li>
</ol>
