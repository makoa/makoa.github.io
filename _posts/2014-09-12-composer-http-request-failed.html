<p>I ran the <code>update</code> command on Composer and received the following error:</p>
<p><code>[Composer\Downloader\TransportException]<br />
The "http://packagist.org/p/symfony/class-loader$78539d95ddac0cc02514ed9cdf1515023dcd289b4f7e03ed948e868a1b02acf2.json" file could not be downloaded: failed to open stream: HTTP request failed!<br />
</code></p>
<p>Seems odd considering I was able to install Composer using <code>php cli</code>. I believe my Apache configuration, which forces all traffic over https, is to blame. I found the following solution in the GitHub forums.</p>
<p>Modify your <code>composer.json</code> file to include the following:</p>
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="js">"repositories": [
    {
        "packagist": false
    },
    {
        "type": "composer",
        "url": "https://packagist.org/"
    }
],</pre>
<p>Then run the <code>update</code> command.  This tells Composer the repository is at <code>https://packagist.org</code>, instead of the default http variation.</p>
