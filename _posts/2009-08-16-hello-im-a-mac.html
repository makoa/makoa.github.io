<p>The first computer I remember using was our family computer.  It was a Macintosh LC!  Here are the specs for those interested:</p>
<ul>
<li>50 MB hard drive</li>
<li>Floppy Drive for 3.5" disks</li>
<li>4 MB (might have even been less) of RAM</li>
<li>10" color screen</li>
<li>running Mac OS 7</li>
<li>StyleWriter black and white inkjet printer</li>
</ul>
<p>It's hard to imagine how far computers have come when now we're in gigabytes.  Back then, getting to 100 MB was a BIG DEAL (remember Zip Disks?).</p>
<p>I currently own a MacBook, an iMac and an iPhone.  So yes, hello, I'm a Mac!  I use a Dell for work.  I do go between worlds.  I do understand why businesses...uh hem...the enterprise...loves Microsoft.  I still wouldn't use it as my platform of choice for my business.</p>
<p><strong>But the Bottom Line...</strong></p>
<p>If you work best on a PC, then that's cool.  Who am I to tell you what tool you should use?  If the tool makes you most productive, then that's the tool you should use.  My tool is a Mac.</p>
