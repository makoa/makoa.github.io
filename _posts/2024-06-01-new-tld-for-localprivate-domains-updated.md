Would you look at that! A problem I wrote about has a an official proposed solution: ICANN is [proposing the .internal Tld](https://www.icann.org/en/announcements/details/icann-seeks-feedback-on-proposed-top-level-domain-string-for-private-use-24-01-2024-en) to fulfill the need I identified.

Looks like I wasn't the only one that said we needed this: https://serverfault.com/questions/17255/top-level-domain-domain-suffix-for-private-network

Something was needed, and it's great that something is coming. .internal works as a name. I liked .local but a conflict would ensue with mDNS.
