<p>I just finished <em><a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a></em> by <a href="http://37signals.com/">37signals</a>.  I have always admired 37signals because of what they do with what little resources they choose to use (notice it is a choice).</p>
<p>The bottom line from the book is the time is now!  Carpe Diem!  Stop wasting time and start building!  I have ideas that have been swimming in my head for some time.  Recently, the ideas have been moving to the front of my head more often than before.  It's really beginning to hurt!  Regardless, it is time to get them out of my head and finally executed.</p>
<p>We will begin with my technical background so that you understand how I find these things problems and the blasphemous solutions I propose.</p>
