<p>Junior year was the transition year.  Peter was graduating and really getting into his New Hope job.  CyberWarriors took a back seat and was slowly handed to me.  But for our last act, the Food Services site got entered into the HiTechQuest contest held in March of 2003.  Our advisors were Clare Ho and Blaine Fergerstrom.</p>
<p>HiTechQuest '03 was held at the Ala Moana hotel.  Oceanic had some conference going on in the main room so we got the area just outside.  The setup was like a science fair.  People walk around (eventually judges) and you talk about your project.  Blaine made us very professional good looking <a href="http://www.zztype.com/cw/cwbc-makoa.pdf">business cards</a> to hand out.  It wasn't just about the project, though.  You had to communicate your project to the judges so there was a speaking component.  And thanks to the Kamehameha speech program, well, that was a breeze.</p>
<p>The judges were impressed because we won first place in Using Technology to Problem-Solve.</p>

<p>This was the end of the fun stuff.  What's next is where the real foundation for KS Connect begins.</p>
